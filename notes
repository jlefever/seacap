TagMap: A map from blob ids -> TreeTag roots

We have a single thread walking the commit DAG. For each commit, we calculate the diff between it and its parent (assuming 1-parent for now). For each file in the diff, we get the tags of the old blob and new blob. Cache them in TagMap. Then run the following function.

A function from (oldTreeTagRoot, newTreeTagRoot, edits) -> a list of changes

Then insert the changes into the database.
